### Step 17: Camera System Improvements

- **Enhanced Isometric Camera Behavior**:

  - Implemented a Diablo-style camera that consistently follows the player
  - Modified the camera to maintain a fixed isometric angle while following the player
  - Ensured the map remains static in its isometric form during player movement
  - Fixed issues with map position shifting when the character moves
  - Adjusted camera positioning to keep the player centered in the view
  - Implemented smooth camera transitions when following the player
  - Optimized camera update logic for better performance
  - Created a more intuitive and user-friendly camera experience

- **Renderer Component Refactoring**:

  - Streamlined the `Renderer.js` component to focus on the camera's follow functionality
  - Removed the `useStaticView` property from the constructor to simplify camera logic
  - Updated the `updateCameraPosition` method to ensure the camera maintains a fixed isometric angle
  - Modified the camera to always look at the player's position, keeping them centered
  - Removed the `toggleStaticView` method as it was no longer needed
  - Simplified the `setFollowTarget` method by removing the static view parameter
  - Enhanced the camera's follow logic to provide a consistent gameplay experience
  - Improved code readability and maintainability through focused refactoring

- **InputManager Updates**:

  - Removed the `toggleCameraStaticView` method and related key binding from `InputManager.js`
  - Simplified the key bindings to focus on essential camera and movement controls
  - Maintained the camera follow mode toggle functionality for flexibility
  - Streamlined the input handling for a more intuitive user experience
  - Reduced code complexity by removing unnecessary toggle functionality
  - Ensured consistent behavior across different input methods
  - Improved code organization and readability
  - Enhanced the overall user experience through simplified controls

- **Technical Implementation Details**:

  - Used the Three.js camera API to implement smooth camera following
  - Leveraged the event-driven architecture for camera state changes
  - Implemented proper cleanup of event listeners for camera-related events
  - Added comprehensive error handling for camera operations
  - Ensured proper integration with the existing entity system
  - Maintained compatibility with the tournament map implementation
  - Used consistent coding style and naming conventions
  - Added detailed JSDoc comments for all modified methods

- **Benefits of the Camera Improvements**:

  - More intuitive gameplay experience with the camera always following the player
  - Reduced cognitive load on players by eliminating the need to manage camera modes
  - Enhanced visual consistency with the map remaining static in its isometric form
  - Improved focus on the player character during gameplay
  - Better spatial awareness for players in combat situations
  - More consistent experience across different game modes
  - Simplified codebase with removal of unnecessary toggle functionality
  - Improved performance through optimized camera update logic

- **Testing and Validation**:

  - Verified camera behavior across different character classes
  - Tested camera functionality in both standard and tournament maps
  - Confirmed smooth camera transitions during rapid player movement
  - Validated camera behavior during combat scenarios
  - Ensured proper camera positioning at game initialization
  - Tested camera performance with multiple entities in the scene
  - Verified proper cleanup of camera-related resources
  - Confirmed compatibility with existing game systems
