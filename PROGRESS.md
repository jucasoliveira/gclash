  - Added proper shadows and positioning
- Implemented WASD keyboard controls:
  - W/S: Move player forward/backward along the Z-axis
  - A/D: Move player left/right along the X-axis
  - Movement is aligned with world coordinates
  - Set up appropriate movement speed
- Added real-time synchronization:
  - Player position updates sent to server
  - Arrow keys still control camera separately from player
- Enhanced multiplayer experience:
  - Other players shown as orange boxes
  - Real-time updates for player movements
  - Player join/leave notifications
  - Added player tracking on server side

    - Balanced class with medium stats
- Added character selection UI:
  - Created styled selection screen with class descriptions and stats
  - Added class icons with color indicators
  - Implemented selection mechanism with visual feedback
  - Created and styled Start Game button
  - Added JavaScript event handlers for selection
- Updated player creation to use selected class properties:
  - Player model uses class-specific color
  - Movement speed adjusted based on class speed stat
